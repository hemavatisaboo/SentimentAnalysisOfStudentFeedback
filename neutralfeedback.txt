I liked how the professor really got to know the names of all of his students.
No graded homework.
Maybe teaching different ways to do certain things.
It was tough not knowing my grade all semester.
Though I do realize that student absences can really mess this up.
I also liked that one exam was dropped.
He is the bomb.
On top of that he was very accommodating with the difficulty I was having in my personal life so that was extremely wonderful.
No one can teach this module better!
Lecturing style is enganging.
